description: A top line view of US wine consumption

Open ended question: what factors could contribute to the increase in "per resident" wine consumption?

## Wine Consumption Per Resident (US)

### Some thoughts about the visualisation

When comparing independent variables, the biggest no-no is apparently having multiple axes on the same chart. Not sure I entirely agree however  [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3099219/plot-with-2-y-axes-one-y-axis-on-the-left-and-another-y-axis-on-the-right) Stack Overflow post does a good job summarising it and providing references.

The challenges specific to this visualisation:
1. showing more than two independent (but possibly interrelated) variables
2. all variables are measuring very different things (litres vs dollars vs numbers)
3. Data labels (more on that later)

As all charts were showing variables over time, I resolved that showing multiple charts vertically with the X-axis fixed ("Years"), would highlight visually the relationship between them. The next challenge was to remove the visual clutter brought on by the X-axis labels.

![WinevsGDPvsPop]({{ site.baseurl | prepend:site.url}}/img/1024x680_plain.png){: .center-image }<b>Figure 2: </b> Earlier version with cluttered x-axis

Since I had locked the X-axis on all charts, making it easier for viewers to draw a visual line downward across all charts, I was able to remove most to the X-axis labels with sensible breaks.

#### Points of interest

All charts have pretty clear peaks and troughs, although the problem here was to highlight these in an elegant manner and enable the viewer to easily work out which year these points of interest occur.

##### Problem 1: Data labels

Visually, it is easy to distinguish the points of interest in this chart as they all lay outside a clear (imaginary) trend line. The trickiness is to get ggplot to recognise this. So using some simple math (LOESS regression) I created a trend line with the data, and with a bit of tweaking anything outside of that line I would show a data label.

![Regression]({{ site.baseurl | prepend:site.url}}/img/1024x680_loessline.png){: .center-image }<b>Figure 3: </b> Loess regression line in red on the original data.

Regression code:

```
loessFit <- loess(df$Total.Wine.per.Resident.litres~df$Year, df, span = 0.6)
loessFit <- data.frame(x=loessFit$x,y=loessFit$fitted)
```

Tweaking parameters to remove all labels except for the points of interest. What the code below does is take the absolute value of the difference between the actual data and the value predicted by the LOESS regression that is greater than 1.03. This value is the 'tolerance' - imagine the red line becoming thicker by 1.03 and only data that lay outside that becomes visible.

```
df[abs(df$Total.Wine.per.Resident.litres - loessFit$y) > 1.03,]
```

The data labels have repeated values, which if displayed overwrite each other, so I remove duplicates from the label dataframe.

The third chart was a straight line so I decided to label the first and last point for reference.


##### Problem 2: Year labels

This ties in with the X-axis visual clutter problem highlighted above. Showing the value of the points of interest (via the data labels) was not enough unless you could pinpoint the year these values occurred.

I solved this problem by customising the theme and X-axis breaks... details below.

#### Themes

After mocking up the chart using default ggplot settings, I started to explore options. Critically, one data label for the first chart was overlapping with the column (black on black). Whilst I could customise the positioning of the label (as I did for year=2016), I could not place it close enough to the column without overlapping other columns or losing it's reference point. I thought about adding the data labels on the inside of the columns, however you would have to flip the data label 90 degrees, and at the size of the columns the text would have to be small. This felt like a clumsy workaround so instead I changed the colours of the columns so as to be able to contrast the black of the label text. I chose a deeper red to evoke Wine, and matched the same colour for the other two line charts for aesthetic reasons.

ggplot has a good library ```ggthemes``` which has a number of ready made custom themes to help you easily theme your charts, from using established style guides for major publications ([economist.com](https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/11/daily-chart-19), [fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-s-has-never-been-so-polarized-on-guns/), etc..)

The Wall Street Journal theme had a pleasing minimalistic aesthetic, however I needed to override the theme defaults to get the Y-axis title to show - with this code:

```
theme_wsj.custom <- theme_set(theme_wsj()) %+replace% theme(axis.title = element_text(colour = "black",size=10, family="Arial"))
```

and then add the theme to ggplot as you would normally do.

### Further research:
- What is the proportion of European based immigration from Wine drinking countries
- What is the growth of real income in the same time period
- How does the consumption of other alcoholic drinks compare? (i.e beer, spirits, etc..)
